                <p>Design is a universal word that could mean various things. Design could mean architecture, computer platforms, data bases, responsive websites, graphics, and so on. Within my realm the word "design" is used to implement a creative strategy.
                    By focusing on a creative strategy I have managed to branch out to communication design, user experience, user interface, anything that can try to answer a question with a visual solution while keeping the user at the center.</p>
                <p>What exactly are the steps to a successful UX process? In most cases you need to <em>plan, discover, explore, define, design, validate, and</em> <em>deliver</em>. Theses steps help keep our focus, goals, and measurable outcomes. Check
                    out my <a href="#work">work</a> to view some examples.</p>

                <h4>Design Sprints</h4>
                <p>A great way to find a solution to a problem are design sprints and design sprints are a common tool among AF CyberWorx. Teams of various individuals, ranging from airmen to industry partners, come together in a dynamic innovation space
                    and use techniques of design process to discover and define the correct problem and solution.</p>

                <h3>Go Go Geology Mobile Application</h3>
                <p>After defining the problem after the discovery phase, users were seeking a way to locate prominent geological sites for hobbyists and high level geologists. By collaborating, converging and diverging, taking into account of pain-points,
                    and keeping a human centered design approach, a solution was identified. By developing an interactive mobile application users are able to quickly obtain information through mobile GPS and manual input of desired and/or current location.
                    Various steps of the UX process were used in order to emphasize, discover, define, ideate, and produce the concept of Go Go Geology.</p>

                <p>I obtained my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Communication Design and proceeded to obtain a minor in Geology, which was not required, but I wanted to illustrate how user experience can be implemented in all areas. After graduation I pursued
                    my dreams of becoming a UX/UI designer where I could apply design skills while creating a wonderful experience for users. I enrolled into a Masters program and will be graduating in October 2021 with my Masters of Computer Science
                    in Software Engineering.</p>
                <p>I've worked with diversified clients and companies ranging from IT software to independent craftsmen. My most recent journey has been with Parson where I am the Space Operations Lead Software UX/UI Engineer. Here, I help with mission applications,
                    create dashboards, construct data, run analysis, and develop with other software developers. Previous to Parsons, I was a civilian contractor at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. There I mentored cadets,
                    who will in turn become officers, apply UX research, methodologies, and focus on human centered design. I have been a part of the growth of AF CyberWorx where I helped develop a brand name, created various design materials, accompanied
                    design sprints with assorted stakeholders, airmen, and civilians. </p>
